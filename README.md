# Book_Store_Project
This project analyzes a fictional bookstore's operational data using SQL. We explored three core datasets — Books, Customers, and Orders — to extract insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and stock management. The goal is to support data-driven strategies for improving profitability and customer satisfaction.
