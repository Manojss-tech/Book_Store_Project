# Book_Store_Project
This project analyzes a fictional bookstore's operational data using SQL. We explored three core datasets â€” Books, Customers, and Orders â€” to extract insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and stock management. The goal is to support data-driven strategies for improving profitability and customer satisfaction.


ðŸŸ¦ Objective

Identify top-selling books and most profitable genres

Analyze customer purchase behavior across cities and countries

Detect inventory gaps and low-stock items

Understand revenue trends over time

Highlight customers with high purchase values or frequent orders


ðŸŸ¦ Methodology

1.Cleaned and loaded data from three CSV files

2.Established relationships via Customer_ID and Book_ID

Wrote SQL queries to:

* Join tables

* Aggregate revenue

* Filter top customers

* Identify underperforming genres and stock shortages

* Derived actionable insights from query outputs


ðŸŸ¦ Key Insights

Examples (you can customize based on actual query results):

Fiction and Thriller genres contributed 60%+ of total revenue

Top 5 customers generated 25% of sales

15 books had zero sales â€” potential for markdown or promotion

Multiple customers from tier-2 cities showed high engagement

Several books have fewer than 5 units left in stock


ðŸŸ¦ Recommendations

Restock high-performing books in Fiction & Thriller categories

Promote unsold books through bundled offers or discounts

Target high-spending customers with loyalty programs

Expand marketing to cities showing strong growth

Optimize stock management by tracking reorder thresholds


ðŸŸ¦ Conclusion

SQL-based analysis of bookstore data provided actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and inventory gaps.
These findings can help management enhance operational efficiency and boost revenue.
